Description: Extensible RESTful server for any DBI-supported database.
 Jarvis is a standalone server script which provides HTTP access to any
 SQL-based database known to the Perl DBI library.  You can implement an
 simple front end for secure, web-based (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
 access to any database table by writing SQL statements with no code required.
 For enhanced features you can write Perl "plugins" and "hooks" to suppliment
 SQL functionality, and to add generic back-end enhancements such as auditing.
 Jarvis can be used with any HTTP client.  It has been extensively tested with
 jQuery, ExtJS and Flex clients in all major browsers.  An extensive PDF
 documentation manual is provided.  It contains the package change log, and
 how to integrate Jarvis with your web-based client software.  A complete
 client/server demo is also included.
